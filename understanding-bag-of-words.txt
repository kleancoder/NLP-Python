Bag of Words 
============

Machine learning algorithms can not work with basic text or raw text, rather 
they can work with vectors of numbers. 

For machine learning algorithms, we need to convert the text into vectors of numbers, 
and this process is called feture extraction. 

The bag of words model is a simple feature extraction technique where information 
about the order or structure of words is discarded. That's why this approach 
is called a bag of words. This approach tries to understand whether a known 
word occurs in a document, but don't know where is that word in the document. 

There are three steps to work with bag of model approach
Step 1: load the data 
Step 2: design the vocabulary 
Step 3: create the document vectors
